<!-- # Chapter 1: Introduction and Overview -->

Welcome to the first chapter of your journey into **Quantum Computation and Quantum Information**.
This chapter provides an essential foundation for understanding the rest of the field, including its motivations, history, and core concepts.

We will introduce:

- The historical context of quantum computing
- The concept of qubits
- Quantum circuits and gates
- Simple quantum algorithms
- Quantum teleportation

Whether you are a student, researcher, or just curious, this chapter will help you understand why the quantum world is both powerful and strange.

<!-- ## Topics in This Chapter -->
